# UAH Satellite Power Scheduling System Technical API Reference Documents

These documents provide an easily navigable collection of reference material based on the embedded XMLDoc comments in the source code. This source code is fully documented for `public` and `protected` members.

On the left side, project navigation is broken down by project name and namespaces. For an overview of what each project is used for, along with it's contained namespaces, consult the **Articles** tab. Each project has it's own article written that provides an overview of the high level functionality, as well as a summary of how the code is arranged and how the different modules interact.

Once a specific class or namespace has been selected on the left, low-level design details will be shown on the right. For any summarized element in the API documentation, a "View Source" link will be shown. This link will immediately jump to the correct line in the source code on GitHub for the element being inspected.
