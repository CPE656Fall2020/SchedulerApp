## Purposes and Intro
This content is presented as a series of articles (in Markdown), combined with API/code documentation based on inline code annotations throughout the system. We intend for this content to:
1. Provide an entry-point for developers who want to expand upon our work
2. Be a living document that evolves with the application. We believe in this philosophy so much that our entire technical documentation is hosted in Git along with the code, and an automated build pipeline compiles and publishes a complete and up-to-date revision of this manual after EVERY commit to the `master` branch.
3. Provide Articles that outline the "50,000 ft" view of the system
4. Provide Articles and reference sheets that provide information future developers may need to know about project setup, tooling, and policies.
5. Provide in-depth, up-to-date Component Level Design information for the entire application API.

## Getting Started
Use the **Articles** and **Api Documentation** tabs at the top of the page to navigate to each section of the reference. We recommend reading through the **Articles** first.
